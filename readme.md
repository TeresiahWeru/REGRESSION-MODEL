Road Accident Severity Prediction Model

# Road Accident Severity Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves creating a linear regression model to analyze and predict road accident severity based on various influencing factors. The model aims to provide insights that can help improve traffic safety and inform policy decisions, particularly in underdeveloped countries.

## Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to predict the number of victims involved in road accidents using a linear regression model. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical accident data, including various factors such as location, time of day, weather conditions, and demographic information.

### Dependent Variable
- **Number of Victims**: Total number of injured or killed individuals in an accident.

### Independent Variables
- **Location**: Categorical variables indicating the accident's location.
- **Time of Day**: Categorical or numerical representation of the time.
- **Weather Conditions**: Categorical variables indicating the weather (e.g., clear, rainy).
- **Type of Road**: Categorical variables indicating the type of road.
- **Vehicle Types Involved**: One-hot encoded variables for different vehicle types.
- **Demographics**: Information about victims, such as age and gender.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should be a CSV file containing historical road accident data. Ensure that the dataset includes relevant features as described above.

> **Note**: Replace `path_to_your_accident_data.csv` in the code with the actual path to your dataset.

## Model Development
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
2. Define the dependent and independent variables.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Create and train the linear regression model.
5. Save the trained model for future use.

### Sample Code
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_accident_data.csv')

# Define your dependent and independent variables
X = data[['location', 'time_of_day', 'weather_conditions', 'road_type', 'vehicle_types', 'age', 'gender']]
y = data['number_of_victims']

# One-hot encode categorical variables
X = pd.get_dummies(X, drop_first=True)

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the model
joblib.dump(model, 'accident_severity_model.pkl')
```

## How to Use the Model
To use the saved model for making predictions, follow the following steps:

1. Load the saved model.
2. Create a DataFrame with the hypothetical independent variable values.
3. Use the model to make predictions.

### Sample Code for Prediction
```python
# Load the saved model
model = joblib.load('accident_severity_model.pkl')

# Create hypothetical data
hypothetical_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'location_city_A': [1],
    'time_of_day_morning': [1],
    'weather_conditions_clear': [1],
    'road_type_highway': [0],
    'vehicle_types_car': [1],
    'age': [30],
    'gender_M': [1]
})

# Make a prediction
prediction = model.predict(hypothetical_data)
print(f"Predicted Number of Victims: {prediction[0]}")
```

## Benefits of the Model
- **Data-Driven Insights**: It helps identify factors contributing to accident severity.
- **Resource Allocation**: Informs where to allocate resources for traffic safety.
- **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Provides data for educational initiatives.
- **Informed Policy Making**: Aids in developing policies to reduce accidents.
- **Improvement of Emergency Services**: Enhances strategies for timely responses to accidents.
